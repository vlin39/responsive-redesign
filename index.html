            <p>
              During Spring 2025, as part of an Interaction Design class, 
              I explored the interface of elevators. As part of this project, 
              I learned to make real-life observations and construct 
              unbiased interviews in public, as well as how to illustrate user needs 
              and experiences based on empirical observations through personas and storyboarding. 
              I also learned to create engaging narratives that demonstrate the user journey 
              end-to-end and the user's interaction with, in this case, the elevator interface.

              <li>Where/in what scenarios do you use the elevator?</li>

              <li>What buttons are there? What do you press? How do you know which direction you’re going?</li>
              <li>How do you wait for the elevator? Where do you look? What about when there’s one elevator vs multiple?</li>

              <li>What do you do when the elevator is open in front of you, you’re further away (you were not waiting, you’ve just arrived) and there seems to be room in the elevator?</li>
              <li>What do you do when the elevator is full and you’re waiting for the next one?</li>
              <li>Do you check which floor you’re on? How do you determine that?</li>
              <li>How do you know which floor you’re going to?</li>
              <li>How often do you encounter elevators with a legend for the levels inside/outside? Like, the list of what’s on each floor?</li>
              <li>In what situations do you check the levels? Do you normally check them inside/outside?</li>
              <li>How do you find the button for the floor you need to go to when inside the elevator?</li>
              <li>How are you inside the elevator? Where do you stand? Where do you look?</li>
              <li>Do you move while the elevator is moving? If you’re getting out, and you’re at the back…</li>
              <li>What do you do if the elevator stops?</li>
              <li>What do you do if someone gets in while you’re in the elevator?</li>

          <h3>Observations + Interview Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When waiting for the elevator, people tend to press the button repeatedly when there’s no visual indicator. </li>
            <li>Inside the elevator, people tend to press a button repeatedly if the doors stay open for a while (this button is usually their destination floor, interestingly).</li>
            <li>Button layouts tend to be inconsistent</li>
            <li>When people want to keep an elevator’s doors open for a while, they tend to use the button.</li>
            <li>When people want to get an elevator’s closing doors to open, they tend to use their arm or foot. </li>
            <li>When traveling alone, people tend to look at the visual indicators while waiting inside or outside the elevator. The next most common place to look is roughly tied between a floor legend (if there is one) and the floor.</li>
